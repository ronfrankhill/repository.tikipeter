Sorry to bother you. Thank you very much to maintaining and improving Fen. I am enjoying it a lot. I don't know if you would be able to benefit from this information that l discovered. Here's the GitHub link https://github.com/itsToggle/trakt-scraper to investigate. Thank you again.

# Rules for Posting Issues...

* **ALL** Issues opened **MUST** include a log. **THIS INCLUDES EVEN WHEN A LOG ISN'T NEEDED i.e. A REQUEST FOR A NEW FEATURE. NEW ISSUES WITHOUT A LOG ATTACHED WILL BE DELETED, NO EXCEPTIONS.**
* You **MUST** look at existing Open Issues to see if your problem is being addressed already before opening a new issue.
* **NO** requests to bring back features/useability that has been changed/removed.
* **NO** complaining about issues/useability of Fen. There are plenty of other addons out there if it does not fit your needs.
* **NO** hijacking of another's Issues thread with unrelated problems. Also, no "Me Too" posts unless you provide a log as well. They are not helpful.
* If you open an Issue, you **MUST** monitor that Issue. If I need more info or another log for your problem, and you don't reply within 24 hours, the Issue will be closed. I cannot wait days with open Issues where there is no reply to a request for more info..
* If issue is **Trakt** related, you **MUST** wait at least 1 day of observed problem before lodging an issue. Trakt has a fragile API, and usually issues to do with Trakt are due to that. Wait a while and check again, DO NOT come straight to here and lodge an issue.

I will close any Issues and delete any posts that fail to abide by these rules.
I will also close any issues at any time for any reason I deem necessary.
